# Simple playing-card-war-game-in-C#
I have developed card war game with object oriented program in C# console application.
This programme is based on a War card game. It Contains 3 players named as Sheetal, Pravin and Tanush. 
Execution Steps as below :
1. Create three Players
2. Create 52 Cards
3. Shuffle cards and distibute between three players.
4. Play game
5. Check game end by winning player or timeout i.e. 30 second
6. Need confirmation from user as want to play next game.
7. If yes then start new game else exit game.

It's divided into different classes. Its a working program with shuffling cards and showing the winner.
